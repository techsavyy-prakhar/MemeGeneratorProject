Event Listeners in React

Conundrum

State in React 
1. As react is declarative we just have to use the React states to add our data 
unlike in javascript we have to specify where and how but in  react we only need to take care that data is correct 
states will allow 
jo values state m save hongi unke according react ui mein changes kardega

2. React.useState("Yes")// Intitial State is Yes 

array return karega and uss array mein ['initial state',function]
this function allows u to change the current state as and when required 

if we want that on clicking on a particular element we want to change the value to no
so we simply write 
this allows the funtion that is returned in the array to change the value of the initial state
function("No")
